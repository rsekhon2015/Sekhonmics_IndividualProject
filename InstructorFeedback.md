### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Hi Ron, This sounds like a useful application and since you are both the customer and the developer, it should be easy to gather user requirements!

* Project object/problem statement looks good. Creative app title too!

* I like that you've utilized a real calendar to begin your planning.  To help with that process, make a list of all the tasks that will need to be completed and assign a time estimate to them. Then, take those tasks and get them on the calendar. Here's a start at a list to help you: design UI, design database, document application flow, create database tables, add data to tables, write weekly blog/wiki/status report, design classes, research sending a message (email?) from the application, etc.

* What web service will you be using in your application?

* What will your individual research topic/technique/technology be?  One option might be sending email from within the application.
